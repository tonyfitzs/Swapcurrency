# How to Install Swapcurrency as a PWA on Android

Follow these steps to install Swapcurrency as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your Android phone:

## Method 1: Using Chrome Browser (Recommended)

1. **Open the App in Chrome**
   - Open Google Chrome on your Android phone
   - Navigate to your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/Swapcurrency/`)

2. **Wait for the Install Prompt**
   - Chrome may automatically show an "Add to Home Screen" banner at the bottom
   - If you see it, tap "Add" or "Install"

3. **Manual Installation (if no prompt appears)**
   - Tap the **three-dot menu** (⋮) in the top-right corner of Chrome
   - Select **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install app"**
   - You may see a preview of how the app will appear
   - Tap **"Add"** or **"Install"** to confirm

4. **Verify Installation**
   - The app icon will appear on your home screen
   - Tap it to open Swapcurrency as a standalone app (no browser UI)

## Method 2: Using Other Browsers

### Samsung Internet
1. Open the app in Samsung Internet
2. Tap the menu (three horizontal lines)
3. Select "Add page to" → "Home screen"
4. Confirm the installation

### Firefox
1. Open the app in Firefox
2. Tap the menu (three dots)
3. Select "Install" or "Add to Home Screen"
4. Confirm the installation

## Troubleshooting

### If "Add to Home Screen" is not available:
- Make sure you're using a recent version of Chrome (version 67+)
- Ensure the site is served over HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides this automatically)
- Try refreshing the page and waiting a few seconds
- Check that the manifest file is loading correctly

### If the app doesn't work offline:
- Make sure you've visited the site at least once while online
- The service worker needs to cache the app files first
- Check the status indicator in the app - it should show "App cached for offline use"

## Features After Installation

Once installed as a PWA:
- ✅ Opens as a standalone app (no browser UI)
- ✅ Works offline (uses cached exchange rates)
- ✅ Appears in your app drawer
- ✅ Can be launched from home screen
- ✅ Updates automatically when new versions are available

## Uninstalling

To remove the PWA:
1. Long-press the app icon on your home screen
2. Select "Uninstall" or drag it to the uninstall area
3. Alternatively, go to Settings → Apps → Swapcurrency → Uninstall
